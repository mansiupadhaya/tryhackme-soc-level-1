TryHackMe SOC Level 1 Certificate 

## Learning Objectives: 
* Detect and analyse traffic anomalies
* Monitor endpoints for threats
* Utilise SIEM tools to handle incidents
* Investigate forensic artefacts

## My Personal Experience
I had the opportunity to explore TryHackMe's SOC Level 1 path, which gave me a solid foundation in security operations. This path focused on some key areas such as detecting traffic anomalies, Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR), phishing, working with SIEM tools, and more. The highlight was definitely the capstone challenge, which simulated a real-time SIEM environment. It let me handle real-world incidents, analyse different TTPs, and dig into forensic artefacts, giving me a hands-on feel for how security teams respond to incidents.
